I
I'm a Research Assistant at the [Machine learning lab](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) at the [University of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/en/), where I specialize in __NLP, Agentic Systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs)__. My work in this area began after I earned my M.Sc. in Embedded Systems Engineering with a specialization in AI from the same university.

Beyond my core focus, I have a broad interest in deep learning applications, including __Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, and Computer Vision__.
